This repository contains the datasets presented in the BMC Genomics paper "Integrative analysis of DNA methylation and microRNA expression reveals mechanisms of disparity in hepatocellular carcinoma" by Rency S.Varghese, Megan Barefoot et al.

Preporcessed data from DNA methylation, miRNA-seq and mRNA-seq for HCC and adjacent normal tissues from 8 African American and 8 European American HCC patients.
The data has been preprocessed and non-normalized data is provided.
